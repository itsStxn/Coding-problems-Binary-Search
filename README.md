# Binary Search

## Difficulties

### Easy

- Binary Seach

### Medium

- Search a 2D Matrix	
- Koko Eating Bananas	
- Find Minimum In Rotated Sorted Array	
- Search In Rotated Sorted Array	
- Time Based Key Value Store

### Hard

- Median of Two Sorted Arrays

## Patterns

- Search in a **sorted array or sorted range**
- Asked to find **an exact value**
- Asked to find **first or last occurrence**
- Asked to find **leftmost / rightmost valid index**
- Asked to find **minimum or maximum that satisfies a condition**
- Problem statement hints **“log n”** or large input size
- Search space is **indexes**, not values
- Search space is **values**, not array elements
- Condition is **monotonic** (false → true or true → false)
- Asked to find **smallest / largest possible answer**
- Use of **mid = (l + r) // 2** logic
- Decision at mid **cuts the search space in half**
- Involves **rotated sorted arrays**
- Involves **peak or pivot finding**
- Uses **binary search on answer**
- Requires handling **edge cases carefully**
- Involves **infinite or unknown bounds**
- Uses **while l <= r** or **while l < r** loop
- Problem can be reframed as **yes/no check function**
